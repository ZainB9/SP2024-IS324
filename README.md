This GitHub repository contains contents (Python scripts and data for the lab session) for Spring 2024 IS 324 Social Network Analysis. 

The network of social beings can come in a variety of forms and structures. We communicate and leave evidence of our interactions in various forms of data. For example, we leave traces of our interactions in the form of text messages, emails, and social media posts. We also leave traces of our interactions in the form of physical proximity, such as co-location and co-attendance. These traces of interactions can be transformed into a network structure. However, the network structure is not always visible and straightforward. In addition, it is not always provided in a structured format (e.g., a list of nodes and edges).
Therefore, to study social networks, it is important to start building a network structure from unstructured data (i.e., text data) and excavate the underlying structure of the network. Processing text data and transforming it into a network structure is the fundamental step in social network analysis. This course will introduce students to hands-on experience with social network analysis (SNA) and its applications in various fields. Students will learn (1) fundamental concepts and theories of SNA, (2) how to build a network structure from unstructured data, (3) how to analyze the network structure, and (4) how to interpret the results of the analysis. Students will also learn how to apply SNA to various fields, such as information science, and social science. This course will use Python as a (1) pre-processing tool, (2) network analysis tool, and (3) visualization tool. Students will learn practical skills in Python, such as data cleaning, data transformation, and data visualization for SNA. Combining theories and practical skills, students will learn how to apply SNA to various fields.
